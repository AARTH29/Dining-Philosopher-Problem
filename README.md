# Dining-Philosoper-Problem
The problem statement is about five philosophers who must alternatively eat and think. All five are sited in a round table with a plate of spaghetti and forks adjacently placed between philosophers. A fork can only be used by one philosopher at a time. However in order to eat, two forks are required – fork in one’s left and right. A philosopher can take an available fork but is not allowed to eat unless the philosopher has both his left and right forks. It should be noted that eating is not limited by the possible amount of spaghetti left or stomach space. It is assumed that there is an infinite supply of spaghetti and demand.
